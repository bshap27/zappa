	<%= select_tag(:venue_id, options_for_select(@venue_array)) %>
	<p>or add a new one:</p>

- try to use simple form
- try to style the whole form using bootstrap to avoid styling each form field
- make sure that clicking submit will add new venue and tie it to the event. will probably have to add an 'accepts nested attributes for' clause in event model.

- venues have a lot more info: 
		t.string   "street"
    t.string   "city"
    t.string   "state"
    t.integer  "zip"
    t.boolean  "bring_pa"
    t.string   "mailing_address_street"
    t.string   "mailing_address_city"
    t.string   "mailing_address_state"
    t.integer  "mailing_address_zip"
    t.integer  "num_posters"
    t.string   "dos_contact"
    t.string   "venue_notes"
  consider allowing user to add venue name and then add the rest of the info AFTER, ONLY if there's a new venue added by text field.

  also consider if user enters a venue name that already exists, to pull from the existing.

  note that num_posters, dos_contact and venue_notes are specific to the band. need band_venue join model for this, extract out of venue model. bring_pa should be extracted too. 

  1. create event (with venue name) that includes band performing (can add/select multiple.)
  	1a. if new venue, ask for more info on venue in screen 2.
  2. enter band-specific info **for any band you are a member of.
